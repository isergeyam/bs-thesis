  abstract   = {We introduce Jinja, a Java-like programming language with a formal semantics designed to exhibit core features of the Java language architecture. Jinja is a compromise between the realism of the language and the tractability and clarity of its formal semantics. The following aspects are formalised: a big and a small step operational semantics for Jinja and a proof of their equivalence, a type system and a definite initialisation analysis, a type safety proof of the small step semantics, a virtual machine (JVM), its operational semantics and its type system, a type safety proof for the JVM; a bytecode verifier, that is, a data flow analyser for the JVM, a correctness proof of the bytecode verifier with respect to the type system, and a compiler and a proof that it preserves semantics and well-typedness. The emphasis of this work is not on particular language features but on providing a unified model of the source language, the virtual machine, and the compiler. The whole development has been carried out in the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL.},

  abstract  = {In the spirit of the famous CLI stack project [2] the Verisoft project [31] aims at the pervasive verification of entire computer systems including hardware, system software, compiler, and communicating applications, with a special focus on industrial applications. The main programming language used in the Verisoft project is C0 (a subset of C which is similar to MISRA C [20]). This paper reports on (i) an operational small steps semantics for C0 which is formalized in Isabelle/HOL [25], (ii) the formal specification of a compiler from C0 to the DLX machine language [14, 23] in Isabelle/HOL, (iii) a paper and pencil correctness proof for this compiler and the status of the formal verification effort for this proof, and (iv) the implementation of the compiler in C0 and a formal proof in Isabelle/HOL that the implementation produces the same code as the specification.},

  abstract  = {We present a framework for simultaneously verifying the functional correctness and the worst-case asymptotic time complexity of higher-order imperative programs. We build on top of Separation Logic with Time Credits, embedded in an interactive proof assistant. We formalize the O notation, which is key to enabling modular specifications and proofs. We cover the subtleties of the multivariate case, where the complexity of a program fragment depends on multiple parameters. We propose a way of integrating complexity bounds into specifications, present lemmas and tactics that support a natural reasoning style, and illustrate their use with a collection of examples.},
